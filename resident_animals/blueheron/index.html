    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>The Great Blue Heron has long legs, a strong dager-like bill, and a shaggy appearance due to the plumes around its head, chest and wings. They are blue-gray in coloring and have a black stripe over the eye. Most notably they can be identified by the “S” shape made by its neck.</p>
    <h3>Habitat</h3>
    <p>Great Blue Herons are commonly found throughout Minnesota in the warmer months and in the southern areas, year round.  While their habitat ranges a variety of environments, they are likely to be spotted along marshes, riverbanks and freshwater lakes.</p>

            <h3>Great Blue Heron</h3>
            <p class="health_history">This Heron was brought to us by a family that found the bird near their home, unable to fly, and appearing to be in distress.  Upon arrival, the team performed an X-ray and determined she had experienced some type of trauma to her wing that caused a small fracture.</p>
